# How to run

First cd to the repository root directory.

Install the dependencies with `npm i` or `yarn`

Available scripts can be seen by running `npm run`

Execute the development mode version with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

Build the production version with `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Then start it with `npm start` or `yarn start`

It usually opens on http://localhost:3000 where you can view the webpage.
